## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Using Yarn is recomended
npx create-next-app myapp-name -e "https://github.com/riipandi/next-tailwind-starter"

# If you want to use npm instead
npx create-next-app myapp-name --use-npm -e "https://github.com/riipandi/next-tailwind-starter"
```

> Don't forget to change `myapp-name` with your real application name.

## Deploy your own

You'll want to fork this repository and deploy your own Next.js website. Once you have an
image generator that sparks joy, you can setup [automatic GitHub](https://vercel.com/github)
deployments so that pushing to master will deploy to production! üöÄ

[![Deploy to Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/riipandi/next-tailwind-starter&project-name=next-tailwind-starter&repo-name=next-tailwind-starter&env=NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL,NEXT_PUBLIC_MAINTENANCE_MODE)

#### Vercel Configuration (optional)

If you are using monorepo you will need to configure a few things:

- Settings -> General -> Root Directory : `apps/web/`
- Settings -> Git -> Ignored Build Step : `git diff --quiet HEAD^ HEAD ./`

#### Cloudflare Deployment

You need to add `NODE_VERSION` with value `14.19.0` on the environment variables setting.
